* Still need to better handle gameover.
* - Make the invaders come down crashing!
* The invaders should speed up as they are defeated. (fmax)
* Need title screens.
* Need to populate the new menu with features.

/*************\

* DEBUG code has been broken out into separate html, css, and javascript.
* - The debug code is brought in if the debug flag is set.
* - Nicer CSS styling for the debug mode.
* Menu tab at the bottom will open up a slide-up menu that has some user-configurable options.
* - When the menu is closed the game will pause (GAMEVARS.pausedOnMenu) and will unpause when the menu closes.
* - Right now there is a feature in the menu that will let you change the size of player 1's ship.
* On-screen joystick and fire button. They respond to the input from the keyboard.
* - The fire buttons work. The joysticks do not yet.
* - Graphics added to the spritesheet image.
