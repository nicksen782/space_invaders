============================
VERSION 4.

REFACTOR!!

Load spritesheet image. Break up and cache into separate (and resized) images.
	new_spriteSheet has the spritesheet coords.
	DIMS has the new w and h for the broken-out images.

global object: GAMEVARS

global object: DOM
	Holds references to the DOM

Need a better gameloop.

window.onload

The alien ship should move slowly, come out on a timer, and exit the screen when the boundary is reached.

The invaders should speed up as they are defeated. (fmax)

requestAnimationFrame should be used, not setTimeout.

frame rate needs to be able to be limited.

Objects: Player, Projectile, AlienShip, AlienInvader, Barrier.

The speed of the projectiles from all entities should not change once set.

Collisions only happen with projectiles and screen boundaries.

New graphics (from the Atari 2600 version of the game.)

Title screen with menu.

Entities can have multiple frames or just one.

Keep track of player shots and hits on enemy.

All canvas draws are written to unattached-to-DOM canvas BEFORE written to the DOM-attached canvas.



============================

There are lots of global variables. They should be stored in a global object.
