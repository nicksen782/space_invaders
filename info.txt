* Still need to better handle gameover.

* The invaders should speed up as they are defeated. (fmax)

* Gameloop on pause now waits 1 second for each unpause check.
* Shots now have a color at the tip to identify the firing origin.
* Fix bug where shots were updated twice per frame.
* document.title prepends "(P) " when paused.
* The html document body is horizontally centered now (even in debug.)
* Invaders can now shoot.
* Hits on invaders now have a temporary animation.
* Points are awarded to the player when an invader is hit.
* Player data now includes shot/hit accuracy.
* Barriers have been added. They block shots but each shot takes some of the barrier away.

============================

http://spaceinvaders.wikia.com/wiki/Space_Invaders_(Atari_2600)

Moving Shields--shields move back and forth
Zigzagging Laser Bombs--Invaders' shots zigzag back and forth towards the earth
Fast Laser Bombs--Invaders' Bombs drop quickly
Invisible Invaders--Invaders are invisible unless one (or the Command Alien Ship) is shot, which they then briefly reappear
Large laser cannon--flipping a difficulty switch on the 2600 console to the A position makes players' laser cannons twice as large
